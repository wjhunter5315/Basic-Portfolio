                            I grew up in Mobile, Alabama where my interests mostly involved sports.  I began in Little League baseball, then transitioned into tennis.  I played for several years until an elbow injury kept me off the court.  I then followed some friends into soccer where I found a love for the 'beautiful game'.  After highschool graduation I atended Birmingham-Southen College, a private liberal arts school, where I recieved a B.A. in English.

                            After college I had various jobs before I found a calling as a brewer.  I had always had an interest in cooking, and brewing has many overlaps.  Through my brewing experience I have come to find an appreciation for the diversity of beer given the vast majority is made of only four ingredience; water, malt, hops, and yeast.
